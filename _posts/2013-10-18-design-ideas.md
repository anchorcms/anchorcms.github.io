    The login screen looks pretty cool, but personally instead of `#fffff` maybe `#eceef1`?? it's the same background colour used as the `background-color` in the admin pages??? makes it easier on the eyes. and adds to some consistency??

    Looks great, but i would also prefer `#eceef1` instead of `#ffffff`. The contrast between the button and the background is really a little bit too much.

    Honestly, really dig the login screen from the 0.9 release.
