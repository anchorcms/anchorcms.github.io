Just a brief update on the development progress of Anchor 1.0. Over the past few weeks we've been looking at bringing plugins to Anchor, experimenting with how a user can extend and modify the behaviour of Anchor. This hasn't been an easy or simple task and we are taking our time to make sure we get it done right.

We are also making sure to plug any vulnerabilities that has been spotted, with good use of [php's filter functions](https://php.net/manual/en/function.filter-var.php).
